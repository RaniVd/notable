{"name":"Notable Announcements for Your Team in Slack","tagline":"A quick, informal way to get important messages to your team","body":"### How It Works\r\n\r\nType **/notable** in your chat command line, and it’ll hashtag your message as notable, and post it in the **#General** room. You can do this from any channel in Slack. \r\n\r\n![](https://monosnap.com/file/8HZDDacylABRcmSZkKfhY03QmTr1vN.png)\r\n\r\n![](https://monosnap.com/file/5gMB0EgSCZAtXhac06pXWSb6bRmZ9Z.png)\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, you’ll also get emailed all the #notable announcements from the day:\r\n\r\n![](https://monosnap.com/file/3C8y7lXgRfl24nyZc1AQe7dFjquqWo.png)\r\n\r\n### Why the Harvest Team Uses Notable Announcements in Slack\r\nOur Slack channels are fairly active here at Harvest. GIFs are flying everywhere, people are asking what’s for lunch at all times of the day, and cryptic, random conversations are taking place in the #emoji-only channel. But, mixed in among all the madness, there are actually valid, important things that everyone in the company should know, like:\r\n\r\n* _Hey team, we shipped this new feature today. It’s out to 75% of customers._\r\n* _We’re hiring! If you know any developers, have them apply here._\r\n* _Eike and his wife had a baby boy!_\r\n\r\nIsn’t this what email is for? Not quite. Emails are a bit stuffy and take time to put together. Slack, on the other hand, is much more informal and a quicker way to get a message out. That’s why we’ve chosen it as our channel to make important, company-wide announcements.\r\n\r\n### Downloading Notable Announcements for Your Team\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\n- @jasondew - Developer\r\n- @katierose4 - Product Manager\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support \r\nHave questions or issues?
